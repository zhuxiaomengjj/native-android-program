# Native android runable cpp program
A hello world demo program to show you how to write native cpp program, and run it on android device
## Thanks
  From [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9460251/how-do-i-build-a-native-command-line-executable-to-run-on-android) I find the solution, but it's c, not cpp.  
  In the cpp case, It's a lot of work, solving undefined references, find what lib must linked in, GOD, It's a nightmare. But it's done, you can pull and run.
## how to build and run
  make clean; make; make install; make run
